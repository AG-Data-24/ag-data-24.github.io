## Prop Labz

At Prop Labz, I played a pivotal role in developing and enhancing various aspects of the platform. Here are some key contributions and technologies I worked with:

### Key Contributions

- **API Development**: Designed and implemented robust APIs to enable seamless integration and interaction within the site. This involved creating endpoints for data retrieval, user management, and more, ensuring efficient communication between the client and server.

- **Web Scraping**: Developed web scraping solutions to collect and aggregate data from various sources. This involved extracting relevant information and processing it for use within the platform.

- **Database Management**: Built and maintained a PostgreSQL database to handle and store large volumes of data. Implemented efficient database schemas and queries to ensure optimal performance and data integrity.

- **Prototyping with Streamlit**: Utilized Streamlit for rapid prototyping and creating interactive data visualizations. This allowed for quick experimentation and iteration of features before full implementation.

- **Flask Implementation**: Currently, the site is built using Flask, a Python web framework. This involved setting up the server-side logic, routing, and integration with front-end components.

- **Predictive Modeling**: Recently, added predictive modeling capabilities to the site to assist subscribers in identifying the best bets to place. This feature leverages historical data and advanced algorithms to provide actionable insights and recommendations.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Streamlit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy (if applicable)
- **Predictive Modeling**: Various machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
